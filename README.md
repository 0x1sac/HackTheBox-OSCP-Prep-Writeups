# HackTheBox-OSCP-Prep-Writeups

Writeups for TJNull's OSCP prep list on HackTheBox

This repository contains writeups/walkthroughs for boxes from TJNulls HackTheBox OSCP prep list.

For those preparing for OSCP, this is a great way to learn methodologies, techniques, commands and more that I use in penetration tests.

Note that these writeups assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of penetration-testing, networking and general IT.

New writeups will be added occasionally.
